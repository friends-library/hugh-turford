== Walk in the Spirit

Paul, in his Epistle to the Galatians, chap. v. 16. had this saying,
"`Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.`"
And, in his Epistle to the Romans, chap. viii. 13, he had this saying,
"`If you live after the flesh, you shall die;
but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live.`"
If ever scriptures were written for our learning, these scriptures were;
for much may be learned therefrom.
The end of preaching, in our present age, and many ages past, has been,
that the sons and daughters of men might learn thereby to deny, turn from,
and forsake every evil deed; and come to live a sober, righteous,
godly life in this present world,
that they might have peace with God in their own consciences here,
and eternal life hereafter.

Now to effect this great work,
in which thousands of laborers have for many years been employed,
the apostle gives this short exhortation:
"`Walk in the Spirit,`" affirming unto the Galatians, that if they walked in the Spirit,
they should not fulfill the lusts of the flesh; they should not yield to evil motions,
nor satisfy their carnal desires; which is the only way to mortify the deeds of the body,
and cure all spiritual infirmities.
But this way of God`'s salvation has been so long rejected,
that few in our present age know _what_ this Spirit is,
_where_ they may have acquaintance therewith, or _how_ they may walk therein.
And that our understanding may be opened in this weighty concern, let us consider,

By reading the Scriptures we may find, that Paul was an Israelite,
of the seed of Abraham, and brought up a scholar, well instructed in the law;
and as to his religion, he was a Pharisee.
And what were the Pharisees?
Not a loose, profane people; but, in outward appearance, a very religious people,
zealous for their temple and the service thereof, with all other outward observations;
insomuch that Jesus said of them,
that they make clean "`the outside of the cup and the platter;`" which few now do.

But when the time drew nigh,
in which God would be no longer worshipped in temples made with hands,
but would dwell in, and be worshipped by, sanctified hearts;
and that the laws that were written by that great prophet Moses,
for the house of Israel to observe and walk in,
must no longer be a rule of righteousness,
but Jews and Gentiles must walk by a law proceeding
from the Spirit of God in their inward parts;
when a greater than Moses was come, proclaiming a kingdom at hand,
that consisted of a more excellent righteousness than theirs,
testifying to the faces of those outside worshippers, that,
notwithstanding their great zeal for the temple and the service thereof,
they were but hypocrites and blind guides;--the rulers
of those people were greatly offended,
and, having a bitter spirit notwithstanding their outside righteousness,
endeavored by persecution, to stop the coming of that kingdom; murdering the prince,
and imprisoning his subjects.
In which persecution none was more active than Paul, wasting the churches beyond measure.

But in the height of his persecution, not man, but God, put a stop to his proceedings;
showing him, that it was not men, but Christ in men, that he persecuted:
which was really so; for had not Christ, by his eternal Spirit,
been in those men whom Paul persecuted,
opening the eyes of their understandings to see the emptiness of all shadows,
and to turn from them, Paul would have had nothing to say to them;
but they inclining to the worship of God in spirit, and slighting temple-worship,
Paul looked upon them as a people not worthy to live.

But it pleased God to reveal in Paul the same Christ that he persecuted in others;
and that revelation, or inward knowledge of Christ,
was the foundation of all Paul`'s knowledge in the mystery of godliness.
He had not his future teaching from men, nor from books,
but from the operation of the eternal Spirit of Jesus in himself;
for keeping to the leading of that Spirit, he grew in grace; and as he grew in grace,
he grew in the knowledge of Christ, and so went not up to Jerusalem,
to them who were apostles before him, for instructions or orders:
but in the strength of the Lord, with a book of experiences in his heart,
instead of a bible in his hand, he went into Arabia to preach the gospel to the Heathen.
And what foundation did he lay?
Not circumcision, which was the foundation of the Jews religion; nor John`'s baptism,
which since became the foundation of the Christian religion: for he told the Corinthians,
that Christ did not send him to baptize, but to preach; and thanked God,
that he baptized no more of them than Crispus and Gaius, and the household of Stephanus.

As Paul`'s eyes were then open to see the gift of God in himself,
so his work was to open the eyes of others,
that they might see the gift of God in themselves also.

Those Heathens had, as every man that comes into the world has, an inward light,
that showed them, as it shows us, what is right, and what is wrong; what is just,
and what is unjust:
though in their ignorance they might have as little
regard thereunto as any of us now have.

As the kingdom of heaven consists of righteousness,
Paul`'s work was to reduce those people to a righteous life and heavenly conduct.
And what better foundation could any man lay, in order to a righteous life,
than a light in ourselves, that shines continually, manifesting every unrighteous action?
A guide that, truly followed, will lead unto God, from whom, by unrighteous living,
all men depart.
This, Paul experienced, and his experiences made him an able minister,
capable of preaching without book or study, and confidently to affirm unto the Galatians,
that their way to a righteous life, was to walk in the Spirit; or to keep to this guide.

And thus have I shown how Paul came to be a gospel minister: and now I shall show,
what the people were to whom he wrote those epistles.

The Romans and Galatians, before their conversion, were called Heathens,
for they knew not the true God, but worshipped dumb idols.
A people that lived, as too many now do, in all manner of ungodliness, walking,
as Paul told the Ephesians,
"`according to the prince of the power of the air;`" but being turned from their darkness,
became acquainted with this true light, which never consented to any unrighteous action.

To this light many of those Heathens turned, taking it for their guide,
and confiding therein as a sure foundation;
which was true faith in him who was given for a light to the Gentiles,
and one in nature with the faith of Abraham.

This people became convinced, though many of us are not,
that after they were turned unto the Lord, they had a race to run.
As from God and godliness they had departed, so to God and godliness they were to return.
They did not content themselves, as too many of us do, with a Christian name;
but following this leader, they walked in newness of life, sober, righteous, and godly,
which Paul commended, telling the Galatians that they ran well:
and we should run well also, if we ran the like race; growing, from day to day,
more just, more upright, more honest, more faithful, and more circumspect:
which cannot be expected until we take their guide for our leader.

But the churches of Galatia, being at that time, as Paul called them, little children,
a people of small growth in the knowledge of the mystery of godliness, were by some,
whom Paul wished cut off, persuaded, as many now are, that an upright, sober, godly life,
and blameless conduct, was not enough:
but they must be also in the exercise of some outward worship;
and the Jews`' religion carrying the greatest show of godliness,
they were persuaded to imitate their customs and observations.

But Paul,
having experienced the insufficiency of outward services to change men`'s natures,
and reduce them to a righteous life, told the Galatians, that if they were circumcised,
Christ should profit them nothing.
If they went from an inward guide, to rest, as the zealous Pharisees did,
on outward performances, he that was given for a light and a leader,
would not be their light, nor their leader.
And, indeed, nothing is more evident; for if Christ be _the way,_
if walking by the Spirit be _the means,_ by which we must mortify sin,
and come to a righteous life; whosoever goes from this way, whosoever slights this means,
has no more benefit by Christ,
than a traveller that forsakes his guide has from his guide,
in order to a righteous godly life.

As Christ is a quickening spirit,
it must be by following him in his spiritual manifestations,
that a righteous life is recovered; nothing less can change our natures,
and make us new creatures; and until we are new creatures,
our citizenship cannot be in heaven.

So the epistles of Paul were written to a people
who were on their journey from death to life;
they were come out of Egypt, but not come to the promised land;
they were turned from their darkness, and had their faces towards Zion,
but were not come to the New Jerusalem, the city of God; they had begun in the Spirit,
but were not come to the true worship in spirit; they had received Christ,
but were not rooted and grounded in Christ: and to perfect what was begun,
the apostle put them on nothing but this,
"`Walk in the Spirit:`" keep to your inward guide, the light of righteousness,
for it is that alone that can raise the sons and daughters of men from their fall,
and bring them to a life of righteousness.

The third thing to be considered is, what the apostle calls flesh and spirit,
and wherein we walk after them.

It is evident, that flesh and spirit are both leaders,
otherwise we could not walk after them; and if leaders,
our visible parts must be followers,
bringing forth in our words and deeds what is in our hearts, or conceived in our minds:
for every deed has first a thought, either good or evil.
Evil thoughts arise from that which Paul called flesh:
good thoughts proceed from that which he called spirit.
So then flesh and spirit is a root of evil, and a spring of good, in ourselves.

From the flesh proceed all such motions as lead unto vice:
from the Spirit proceed such doubts as we find in ourselves of yielding thereunto;
and all the rebukes that follow us when we have allowed the enemy to prevail over us;
and those rebukes are in love unto us, as our rebukes are in love to our children,
that they may stand in awe, and not offend.

As oft as we yield to evil motions, we give place to the devil;
and whosoever yields to one evil motion, shall have another of the same kind:
and the oftener we yield, the more ground he has in us,
and the more power he comes to have over us.
And all the refuge that any man has to fly unto, when evil motions arise,
is that in his own heart, that Paul calls the Spirit,
for that will not consent to any evil deed; and whosoever keeps close to that,
keeps close to God; they abide with their guide, and "`walk in the Spirit.`"

The converted Heathens walked by this rule;
they took the eternal Spirit of Christ in themselves for their guide:
they confided therein, and became followers thereof;
and that brought them to be a holy nation, and a peculiar people.
And we should be the same did we turn to this eternal Spirit in our own hearts,
and order our conduct according to the leadings and guidings thereof;
for keeping to this, we should not fulfill the deeds of the flesh.

The fourth thing to be considered is, what the Apostle intended by these words,
die and live.

Certainly he did not, by the word die, intend a cessation of their mortal lives,
for such a dying in the Lord`'s appointed time is common to all men;
they that live after the Spirit, as well as they who walk after the flesh,
must go down into the grave.

But the dying that the Apostle intended, was a decay of our inward life,
a dying unto righteousness; which few in our present age take notice of:
such a dying as the first man Adam died,
when he fell from the government of the eternal Spirit, which was man`'s first state;
or such a dying as the house of Israel died, when they stuck to outward observations,
slighting justice, mercy, and a humble walking with their God.

Now such as walk after the flesh, living in the practice of any known sin,
depart further from God, and come to have less life, less light, less grace,
less fear of offending God, and injuring their neighbors;
as we may see by men`'s conduct.
And this decrease is a dying unto righteousness.

And as they that live after the flesh, have less life, less light, less grace, less fear;
so such as walk after the Spirit, doing such things as are upright, honest,
and of good report, from a principle in their own hearts, find an increase;
they come to have more life, more light, more grace, more fear of offending God,
or their neighbor: and this increase is a living unto righteousness.
As the one goes further from, so the other draws nearer to, the kingdom of heaven.

Had we not in ourselves spirit as well as flesh; light as well as darkness;
a conductor in the way of life and salvation,
as well as a leader in the paths of destruction; we might lay the loss of life,
and all the calamities that sin brings, on Adam`'s score,
or on the account of the wicked one, from whom all wicked motions proceed.

Paul was an expert doctor in divinity;
he knew what corrupted the sons and daughters of men,
and from which all the ungodliness that is in the world does arise; and to cleanse,
to purge, to purify, to make Heathens become sound Christians, and sinners become saints,
describes no other means but this, "`Walk in the Spirit.`"
For as we keep to this, we shall learn, as the converted Heathens did,
not only to deny ungodliness, but also to live godly in this present world.

But if we rest, as the zealous Pharisees did, in outward performances,
accounting ourselves righteous, because we have, as we are persuaded,
a right form of godliness, and make no use of the aforesaid means;
though we have as great a zeal for our forms of godliness,
as ever Paul had for the Jews`' religion,
it will profit us no more than circumcision would have profited the Galatians.

We have had much preaching and teaching;
the joys of heaven promised to them that did well;
the torments of hell threatened to them that did ill;
but have these promises and threatenings made us a holy nation, and a peculiar people,
exceeding all others for justice, equity, truth, and faithfulness?
Have all the exhortations that we have had, enabled us to mortify the body of sin,
which is the cause of ungodliness?
Are we thereby translated, as the Heathens were,
out of the region of darkness into the kingdom of the dear Son of God,
so as to have our citizenship in heaven, while our bodies are on earth?
Can we say, "`Old things are done away,`" all exalted thoughts,
all covetous inclinations, all wrath and bitterness;
and these new things come in their places, humility, meekness, temperance, self-denial,
with unfeigned love to God, and our neighbor?
Can we say, There was a time in which sin had such dominion over us,
that we could not refrain from fulfilling the lusts of the flesh;
but now we are so limited by the eternal Spirit, that we must be temperate,
we must be sober and vigilant, we must be just, upright, and faithful in word and deed.
If this be our state, we are, as the primitive Christians were at their full attainments,
dead unto sin, and alive unto righteousness: built upon the same rock as they were.
But if we are not come to this, it would be our wisdom to turn to the Lord, as they did,
and build on the same foundation that they built upon,
"`The true light that enlightens every man that comes into the
world;`" that we may come to be acquainted with the eternal Spirit,
as they were, and have a guide and leader in the paths of godliness, as they had;
for it is by and through the assistance of the eternal Spirit of
Jesus in our own hearts that our corruptions must be purged out,
and our inside made clean.
For as our walking after the flesh made all wounds;
so it must be our walking after the Spirit that must heal all wounds;
as our living after the flesh was the growth of our unrighteousness;
so by walking after the Spirit we mortify sin, and recover a life of righteousness.

Paul spoke from a good understanding, when he told the Romans,
"`That which may be known of God is manifest within:`"
there he had his knowledge in the mysteries of godliness:
whatever he preached, whatever he wrote, the spring was in himself.
He knew no more of the operation of inward and spiritual grace than one of us,
`'till he came to have his eyes inward, and to walk in the Spirit;
and so he recommended to the churches what he had experienced.

Many can talk of redemption, justification, sanctification, and salvation by Christ:
but he is a Christian who is a witness of such things wrought in himself.
Such may properly be called learned men: they know what it is to rise, what it is to die,
and what it is to live; what they are redeemed and saved from, and by what means.

The fifth thing to be considered is, how the sons and daughters of men may,
through the Spirit, mortify the deeds of the body.

But first, we will consider, what deeds of the body are to be mortified;
which in general are these: as an evil spirit in man is the root of all evil deeds,
so _every deed that proceeds from that root_ is to be mortified:
and nothing can manifest such deeds, giving us a true sight thereof,
but the Spirit of the Lord, or light of righteousness in our own hearts,
as it comes to shine in brightness.

To know what deeds are to be mortified in all our attempts and undertakings,
let us look to our ends therein; if we have nothing in our eye but justice, equity,
honesty, and plain dealings, we may go on with safety; but if self be the moving cause,
if we have not an eye to our neighbor`'s interest as well as our own,
pretend what we will, such deeds proceed from an evil root, and are to be denied;
and in denying them, they come to be mortified.
And what can manifest our ends in every action?
Not books nor preachers; but the Spirit of the Lord, which is an inward light.

But we do not find that Paul directly charged the
Galatians with any manner of loose living,
but with their "`observing days and times:`" and what harm could there be in that?

Though the Galatians might see none, Paul saw much,
otherwise he would not have asked them, Who had bewitched them?
They had begun in the Spirit, they had walked for a season after an inward guide,
which is the only leader to such a life of righteousness as the Lord, in all ages,
required of the sons and daughters of men;
which was not a form of godliness without life, but truth in their inward parts:
for if we have truth in our hearts, equity will be performed by our hands.

And to this Paul knew they could never come by imitating an outward worship,
much less by observing days and times,
(which in our present age is become the nursery of vice) and so counted it +++[+++of the]
deeds of the flesh: reasoning thus with them, "`Are you so foolish,
having begun in the Spirit, are you made perfect by the flesh?`"
Which is all one as to say, Are you so void of understanding,
having begun to walk in newness of life,
do you think to come to such perfection as to have
your citizenship in heaven while living on the earth,
by going back to the performance of outward services: "`This persuasion,`" said he,
"`is not of him that calls you.`"
And if it was not of God, it must be from the old deceiver;
and many have been since deceived thereby, persuading themselves,
that godliness consists in that which is called, but is not, true devotion,
and not in a well ordered conduct, and so live in pride, covetousness, envy,
and many other things, which are really deeds of the flesh;
and never come so far as to mind a translation out of the kingdom of darkness;
to live under the government of the eternal Spirit.

Man`'s fall was not from any outward religion or form of godliness,
but from a life of righteousness: from a state in which husband, wife, parents, children,
masters, servants, and all other relations, would have known their place and duty,
and been found therein: from a state in which the creatures,
that God has given for man`'s use, would have been used, and none of them,
through excess, wasted or abused:
from a state in which truth would have been found in our words,
and equity in all our deeds:
from a state in which the will of God would have been done on earth,
as it is done in heaven, and the great God by us glorified, and not dishonored.
From this state, through the entrance and growth of sin,
the sons and daughters of men are departed; to this state the primitive Christians,
through the mortification of sin, returned.

This was the life that the first Adam lost:
this is the life that the second Adam came to recover.
As many as have the Spirit of Christ, and become followers thereof, rise from their fall,
return unto God, live under his government, and become witnesses of this life restored.

When I have looked upon that called the book of divine service,
I have found as good words therein as could be collected out of the scriptures;
not one to be admitted into the church without security,
promising in their behalf as much as I have mentioned.
The promises therein contained, were they but truly performed,
would make us a holy nation, no way behind the chiefest of saints.
For those that rose highest,
rose no higher than to "`walk in God`'s commands all the days of their lives.`"

But it is rare to find one man that performs that covenant, and the reason is this;
we say the scriptures are our rule, but we keep not thereunto.
Paul`'s advice is not followed, we do not "`walk in the Spirit;`" which if we did,
the light of righteousness, in our own hearts would show us the risings of evil motions,
and what they lead to; and that is the time to "`forsake the devil and all his works,
with all worldly vanities and sinful lusts:`" for if we deny evil motions,
we shall never be found in evil actions; and until we depart from evil,
we cannot do the things that are good.
Sin must be mortified before we can lead a righteous life:
the works of the devil must be denied, before the commands of our God can be walked in,
one day, much less all the days of our lives.

And this Paul experienced, which made him with great confidence to say,
"`Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.`"
For if we deny and turn from every motion that the light
of righteousness in our own hearts shows us to be evil,
we shall not fulfill them, but shall mortify the root from which they arise:
for that which is not fed, in time comes to die.

By this the converted Heathens came to be a holy nation:
this is the way to be citizens of the New Jerusalem: by this means the Colossians were,
and we may be, translated into the kingdom of the dear Son of God,
to live under his government: this is the kingdom that,
John the Baptist proclaimed to be then at hand;
this is the kingdom that the disciples of Christ were to pray for the coming of:
this is the kingdom that consists of righteousness, and stands in power:
this is the kingdom that all believers are first to seek:
for under the government of the eternal Spirit of Jesus in their hearts,
the sons and daughters of men are limited from doing any unrighteous thing.

Many of the present professors of Christianity are persuaded,
that though they are unrighteous in their lives,
yet being in the exercise of something called religion, it shall go well with them.
But the living Lord does not take notice what religion we are of,
but what leader we follow; for let our religion be what it will,
if we live after the flesh, we shall die.
And, though little appears that is called religion, if we walk after the Spirit,
if our citizenship be in heaven, if truth be in our mouths,
and equity performed by our hands, we shall live.
But who are capable of walking after the Spirit, and through the Spirit,
of mortifying the deeds of the body?

We may find many, even among us, who bear the name of Christians, that,
through a perseverance in evil-doing, are become dead in sin,
having no sense or feeling of anything in themselves that is of God:
and such as have no acquaintance with the Spirit, cannot "`walk after the Spirit.`"

Others there are who are not dead, but dying; they have both sense and feeling;
they have that in themselves that would lead them to better things than they practise,
but have little or no regard thereunto; they take it not for their guide;
and while they slight that in themselves which manifests the deeds of the body,
they can in no way mortify them.

But some may be found who are weary of their sins, and burdened with their iniquities,
having in themselves a hunger and thirst after righteousness;
and all such are living people, and capable through the Spirit,
of mortifying the deeds of the body.

Satisfied I am, that in our present age, many have been awakened from the sleep of sin,
and have had in themselves a true hunger and thirst after righteousness;
but being awakened by an outward ministry,
from that they expected to have their hunger and thirst satisfied.

Many may be awakened with, but they are not quickened by, an outward ministry;
"`It is,`" as Jesus said, "`the Spirit that quickens;`" what can raise life,
but that which gives life?
What can satisfy a soul that thirsts after righteousness,
but that which is in very truth the spring of righteousness?
It is in ourselves the well is to be found,
that whosoever drinks thereof shall never thirst;
there is the spring that flows up unto everlasting life.

As the kingdom of heaven stands not in words, but in power; so it is not words,
but the power of God that can mortify the deeds of the body, change our nature,
and make us new creatures.

Would words fill us with righteousness, justice, truth, equity, and faithfulness,
we should have been a holy nation long since; for there has been no lack of words,
but there is still lack of equity and faithfulness in men`'s deeds.

Could good words reduce hearers to a righteous life,
instead of saying,"`Walk in the Spirit,`" Paul would have said to the Galatians,
"`Hearken to your minister:`" he would have had no
need to have recommended unto them an inward guide.
Paul`'s experience evidenced unto him, that it was not by hearing of words,
but through his obedience to the law of the Spirit,
that he came to mortify the deeds of the body, and lead a righteous life:
and what he found to be effectual in himself, that he recommended to the churches.

Words, though never so numerous, may be forgotten, they do not abide;
but the eternal Spirit abides,
that is the teacher that can never be removed into a corner.
The use of words, in the work of salvation, is to awaken such who are asleep in sin,
and to turn them, as Paul turned the Heathens, to an inward guide; and for admonition,
while they are on their journey, to keep with their guide.

Had such, who hungered and thirsted after righteousness,
pressed after what they hungered for;
had they acquainted themselves with the eternal Spirit, that begot those desires,
and followed the leading thereof, it would have rooted out pride and all selfishness;
it would have reduced them to a humble, lowly, meek, patient, peaceable frame,
to keep their promises, to be just in all their dealings,
to do the thing that was right at all times; and this would have removed their burden,
and given them rest and peace.

If we would be as the primitive Christians were, we must begin where they did;
we must turn to the light of righteousness in our own hearts,
and walk in that light until we become children of the light;
we must walk in the just man`'s path by the guidings thereof,
till righteousness becomes our centre.
This made the primitive Christians a religious people indeed; by this they profited;
otherwise the blind ignorant Heathens could not have
come to be fellow-citizens with saints,
and of the household of God.

Paul was no settled minister at any one place, they heard him but seldom;
but they heard the voice of the eternal Spirit, as oft as they strayed from justice,
equity, and faithfulness: and to this voice Christians ought to incline their ear;
for under the new covenant, God does speak unto his people by his Son,
through the eternal Spirit in their hearts.

The first step to a life of righteousness,
is to acquaint ourselves with that in our own hearts that reproves us for unrighteousness:
for until we come to this, we are strangers to the foundation of a right conduct:
for all building, all journeying, all rising, all approaching,
near to the kingdom of God, depends on our denying, turning from,
and utterly forsaking what the light of righteousness
in our own hearts does convict us of,
and reprove us for: for by such denials the deeds of the body come to be mortified.
As we make this our concern, and are faithful therein, our light shines more and more;
and the more light we have, the greater discovery it makes of what is evil,
what is to be denied, turned from, and forsaken; and guiding our steps by this,
we build on the true foundation, we walk in the living way,
we grow in grace and the knowledge of Christ,
and draw nearer and nearer to his kingdom and righteous government;
and all power is felt in a righteous life.

This was the advice of Christ, "`Strive to enter in at the strait gate;`" testifying,
that the way to eternal life was narrow; and what is this strait gate, and narrow way?
Not self-interest, nor yet self-righteousness.

Self-interest is the root of all covetous practices, fraudulent dealings,
and unjust actions.
Self-righteousness is the root of all formality and contention about religion,
of which there has been, and still is, too much in the Christian world,
persecuting one another, as the unconverted Heathens did the primitive converts.

Neither of these paths leads to that kingdom that consists of righteousness and peace.
Had the converted Heathens walked in these paths, they would not have been a holy nation;
their citizenship would have been in the earth, and not in heaven.
But the strait gate, and narrow way, that leads to a righteous life, is _self-denial;_
a denying of everything, the smallest concern, as well as things that seem weighty,
proceeding from an evil root; which nothing can manifest but an inward light,
shining in its brightness.
But with sorrow may we say, it is rare to find one among many,
who lives in the practice of what he himself acknowledges to be right.
Who is there but will confess, that to speak the truth on all occasions is a right thing?
Who is there but will allow, that to keep every promise, though it be to our hurt,
is an honest thing?
Who is there but will grant, that to do unto all men as we would be done by,
is a just thing?
Yet few live in the practice thereof;
and if we do not live in the practice of what we know to be right,
what does our knowledge profit us?
We may, as Israel in the wilderness did, keep moving;
but unless we walk in the narrow way, we can never come to a righteous life.

And so, if we do not willfully shut our eyes, we may plainly see;
that the way to a righteous life,
is to "`walk in the Spirit;`" to follow the leadings of an inward guide;
to deny and turn from what the light of righteousness in our own hearts manifests,
unto us to be unrighteous, unjust, or dishonest.
And by turning from evil, we come to embrace the good; by forsaking vice,
we come to be filled with virtue; by dying unto sin,
we come to be made alive unto righteousness; truth, equity, and honesty,
come to be uppermost, and we come to centre there.
And to such, as Paul said,
"`There is no condemnation;`" they have the answer of a good conscience; peace with God,
and peace in themselves; peace while they are here, and peace when they go hence.
